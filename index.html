          <h3>Puppy Days</h3>
          <p class="blog-text">
            I was born in the perfect fall month of November. Even though I was
            born during the pandemic, I was not a pandemic pup. My parent's
            decided to adopt me at the end of January of 2020. As a puppy I was
            fiesty and didn't like to sleep very much. I hear most pups sleep
            when they are little to grow, but I would sleep only when I wanted
            to. I enjoyed playing with my toys, drinking lots of water, and
            eating anything and everything around me.
